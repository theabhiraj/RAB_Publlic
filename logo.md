# d2Home Logo

## Concept

A minimalist and modern logo that combines the letter "d", the number "2", and a house icon. The logo should be simple, memorable, and scalable.

## Color Palette

- **Primary:** #2563eb (A vibrant blue, suggesting professionalism and trust)
- **Secondary:** #10b981 (A calming green, suggesting growth and home)
- **Text:** #1f2937 (A dark gray for readability)

## Description

The logo consists of two main elements: a stylized house icon and the brand name "d2Home".

### The Icon

- The icon is a simple, abstract representation of a house.
- The left wall of the house is formed by a lowercase letter "d".
- The roof of the house is a stylized number "2".
- The overall shape is contained within a soft-cornered square, giving it a friendly and contained feel.
- The icon uses a gradient from the primary blue to the secondary green, giving it a modern and fresh look.

### The Text

- The text "d2Home" is placed to the right of the icon.
- It is written in a clean, sans-serif font (like Poppins or Lato).
- The "d2" part of the name is in a slightly bolder weight than "Home" to emphasize the brand's uniqueness.
